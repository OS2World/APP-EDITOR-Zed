Foreword
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ZED is 15-day trial shareware.  Please see the section on registering 
for more information.

I encourage you to share ZED with your friends, co-workers, favorite
ftp sites, and BBS systems. If you intend to distribute ZED, please read the
section on distribution.

If you wish to continue using ZED after the 15 day trial period,
you must register.  Please see the section on registration.

I advise you virus-scan the files and/or distribution 
diskette before you install ZED.

1. Registration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ZED is a fully functional text editor for OS/2. Open Source under the 
BSD License.




3. Distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Source under the BSD license. 


4. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ZED will not run until it is installed properly.

ZED 1.1s requires the following files for successful installation:

ZED.EXE
ZED.HLP
ZED.ICO
README.TXT
INSTALL.EXE

If you do not have these files, ZED will not install properly.
Please try to get an original copy of the ZED_10S.ZIP distribution
file or contact me at ivisoft@cybernetics.net or Bruce_Shankle@msn.com.
I will be happy to get you a fresh copy.

ZED will not run unless it is installed with the INSTALL.EXE program that
comes with ZED.

Be sure to virus-scan all files before installing ZED.

To install, run INSTALL.EXE from the distribution floppy diskette or from 
a directory where all of the above files are located.

The install program will prompt for a directory to install to. The default 
is C:\ZED, but you are given the opportunity to change this.

Do not attempt to install ZED to the same directory from
which you are running INSTALL.EXE. The installation will fail.

INSTALL.EXE does not modify any of your system files but will
create a ZED object on the DeskTop.

The ZED.ICO file, the icon for ZED is included for your convenience.
ZED.ICO contains bitmaps for all OS/2 supported resolutions.
You may modify this icon to suite you.

The first time you run ZED, you will be asked to read
the registration information in the online help.  Please take
the time to read the information.
This "nag" occurs only the first time you run ZED, or if
ZED.INI get's deleted.

If you encounter any problems, please contact Bruce Shankle III, the
author at ivisoft@cybernetics.net or Bruce_Shankle@msn.com.

Thanks for trying ZED.
Don't forget to register!!! 8^)
