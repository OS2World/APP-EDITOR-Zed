Text editor for OS/2
Copyright (c) 1995 by E. Bruce Shankle III

Foreword
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ZED is 15-day trial shareware.  Please see the section on registering 
for more information.

I encourage you to share ZED with your friends, co-workers, favorite
ftp sites, and BBS systems. If you intend to distribute ZED, please read the
section on distribution.

If you wish to continue using ZED after the 15 day trial period,
you must register.  Please see the section on registration.

I advise you virus-scan the files and/or distribution 
diskette before you install ZED.

1. Registration
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read all registration information.

ZED is a fully functional text editor for OS/2.  ZED is also shareware.

To register, send cash, check or money order for $20.00 US currency to:

E. Bruce Shankle III
192 Cypress Avenue
San Bruno, CA 94066
USA

Please include your name and address or email address.

You will receive confirmation of your registration along with your 
serial number.  This entitles you to support, free upgrades and notices
of other new products.

If you have any questions or comments,
I can be reached at the above address or one of the following email addresses:

ZED Shareware Agreement
---------------------

You are allowed to use ZED and evaluate it for a period of 
fifteen (15) days from the date of installation.  The original install
date is displayed in the status bar along the lower edge of the main window.
After using ZED for fifteen days, you must decide if it's something you
want to keep.  If you wish to keep ZED, you must register. 
If not, you must discontinue use of ZED.

When you register you will be assigned a serial number that you can use to 
obtain support via email, free upgrades, and notices of new products.

I've put many long hours of coding and testing into ZED.
My goal is to provide an editor for OS/2 that is easy to use and more
functional than those supplied with the system.

The shareware concept only works if you do your part to support the authors.
If you find ZED useful and do not register, you're hurting me and other
shareware developers.  

ZED will continue to function after the 15-day trial period,
as I do not believe in cripple-ware, but you are violating this 
agreement and hurting yourself and me if you don't register.



What is shareware?

Shareware applies to software products you are allowed to try before you buy,
like ZED.
That way, you will know if the product is of use to you.  If you find the
product useful and wish to continue using it beyond the trial period,
you must pay for the product.  This is usually called registration.

If you don't find the product useful, you must delete it from your computer.
It is also nice to contact the author of the shareware and tell them 
why you don't want it and things they could do to improve the product.

Shareware helps keep the software market competitive, and prices
lower for everyone.  The shareware concept does not work when someone 
decides to keep and use a product without registering it.
This hurts the shareware author, and eventually shareware users.
So please register the shareware that you like and use on a regular basis.


3. Distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You are encouraged you to distribute ZED free of charge.

Corporate users and those using ZED in any for-profit organization or business
may contact me and establish a licensing agreement for your site.
I can be reaced at:

Bruce Shankle
192 Cypress Ave
San Bruno, CA 94066
USA

or

Bruce_Shankle@msn.com

If you wish to distribute ZED, distribute the file ZED_11S.ZIP.
This file should be on the original ZED distribution floppy, or it is the
file you downloaded.

ZED_11S.ZIP contains:

ZED.EXE
ZED.HLP
ZED.ICO
README.TXT
INSTALL.EXE

You are not allowed to make any changes to any of the original files.

You are not allowed to sell ZED for profit unless it is part of a 
shareware-only archive like Walnut Creek's HOBBES CD-ROM.


4. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ZED will not run until it is installed properly.

ZED 1.1s requires the following files for successful installation:

ZED.EXE
ZED.HLP
ZED.ICO
README.TXT
INSTALL.EXE

If you do not have these files, ZED will not install properly.
Please try to get an original copy of the ZED_10S.ZIP distribution
file or contact me at ivisoft@cybernetics.net or Bruce_Shankle@msn.com.
I will be happy to get you a fresh copy.

ZED will not run unless it is installed with the INSTALL.EXE program that
comes with ZED.

Be sure to virus-scan all files before installing ZED.

To install, run INSTALL.EXE from the distribution floppy diskette or from 
a directory where all of the above files are located.

The install program will prompt for a directory to install to. The default 
is C:\ZED, but you are given the opportunity to change this.

Do not attempt to install ZED to the same directory from
which you are running INSTALL.EXE. The installation will fail.

INSTALL.EXE does not modify any of your system files but will
create a ZED object on the DeskTop.

The ZED.ICO file, the icon for ZED is included for your convenience.
ZED.ICO contains bitmaps for all OS/2 supported resolutions.
You may modify this icon to suite you.

The first time you run ZED, you will be asked to read
the registration information in the online help.  Please take
the time to read the information.
This "nag" occurs only the first time you run ZED, or if
ZED.INI get's deleted.

If you encounter any problems, please contact Bruce Shankle III, the
author at ivisoft@cybernetics.net or Bruce_Shankle@msn.com.

Thanks for trying ZED.
Don't forget to register!!! 8^)

    Although every effort has been made to insure ZED is a
    stable program, the author, E. Bruce Shankle III, may not
    be held liable for any damages caused by, related to,
    or coinciding with the use of ZED. Use ZED at your own 
    risk.
