ZED Alpha 10 Release notes:

Dear ZED Alpha Tester,


Please refer to the online documentation for more information on
this alpha release of ZED.

I will work on the highest priority features first, so if you would,
please return the following list to me with priorities.
1 is the highest priority.  This is your chance
to take part in the development of ZED.
I know some

I am trying to order this list based on your feedback:

Priority	Feature
--------	--------------------------------
                -Delete file option    (this was my idea)
                -Syntax hi-lighting    (for C code)
                -Bracket matching
                -Disable keyboard buffering for pageup/
                pagedown, and up down arrow keys
                -Option to retain the system cursor 
                instead of the I-beam one

**New         -Option to create file if it does not exist
                    when passed as argument on command line.

**New         -Option to import a file.

**New         -Print preview

Please feel free to add to this list.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Please reply to the following questions regarding ZED:
NOTE: There are some new questions in the list.

Did the ZED icon show up when you added ZED to OS/2?

Did it give you any problems?

Did you like the available printing options?

Did printing work?

Do you have suggestions that might make alpha testing
better? 

Is alpha testing ZED lame or is it fun?

Do you like getting the latest version of ZED each week?

Is ZED still better than E.EXE?

Does ZED fill a niche for OS/2 text editors that
is currenly not filled?

When ZED is finished I've considered writing
a true word processor called ZED-Pro or something
of that nature.  Does the quality of ZED lead you to
believe that I could write a cool word processor for
OS/2?  If ZED-Pro becomes a reality, would you be
interested in testing it?

Is ZED fast enough?

Is ZED something you would suggest to a friend?

Do you have suggestions that can make ZED better?

If ZED were shareware, would you register it?

Did you discover any bugs?

Is there anything that could be added to the status bar
to make it better?

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to use ZED and give
feedback.

01/03/1995	Pseudo-coded editor

01/05/1995	Begin actual coding

01/10/1995	Added multi-threaded file IO, finished coding alpha 1

01/10/1995	Extensive testing.

01/11/1995	Built alpha 1 and distributed to alpha testers.


01/22/1995 	Got feedback from alpha testers.

01/22/1995	Added keyboard accelerators to menu.

01/22/1995	Added Find capability.

01/22/1995	Added "Save and exit" to file menu

01/22/1995	Added "Find next", "Find previous", "Replace" to 
		Edit menu. These options will be disabled until
		the actual coding is complete.

01/22/1995	Tested all keyboard accelerators. 
		Tested "Save and exit" option

01/22/1995	Discovered bug: ZED does not warn if disk space
		is insufficient to store file when saving.
		Fixed bug.

01/22/1995	Distributed Alpha 2 to alpha testers.


______________________________________________
01/23/1995	Began Alpha 3 rev.

01/23/1995	Added alpha revision number to
		About box.

01/23/1995	Coded "Find Next". Made logic such that 
		when find next reaches the end
		of the text it will wrap around to the beginning
		automatically.

01/23/1995	Coded "Replace" dialog box.  Removed
		"Find Previous". Not a high priority option.

01/24/1995	Added "*" to frame title if text is modified.
		When text is saved, "*" disappears. I found this
		common on some editors.

01/24/1995	Added "Verify" to replace logid. This allows replace
		verification. Coded Replace/Verify logic.

01/24/1995	Researched real-time scroll bars.  The MLE
		control only sends vertical scrolling messages 
		when the mouse is released after a scroll.
		Real-time scrolling will not be possible with the 
		current set-up. I will have to use a separate scroll
		bars (Not the ones built into the MLE class) in
		order to achieve real-time scrolling. I may work on
		this next week.

01/24/1995	Made "Undo" menu option enabled/disabled depending
		on whether or not an operation can be undone.
		Originally, this was always enabled, even when nothing
		could be undone.

01/24/1995	Added "*" flag to window title to show
		when a change as made to the text.
		Flag goes away when file is saved.

01/24/1995 	Tested all features added since Alpha 2.

01/24/1995	Distributes Alpha 3 to alpha testers.

___________________________________________________________
01/25/1995   Began work on Alpha 4


01/25/1995	Made "Paste" menuitem disabled if there was no
		text in the clipboard.

01/25/1995    Designed options to change use of Tab to insert spaces
                 and began working on code.

01/26/1995    Tabs are no longer inserted when you press the tab key. I put in 
                spaces instead.  But tabs will come back by using the 
                "Settings... Tabs" option which I haven't coded yet. Bear with 
                me. The "Tab" settings window doesn't do anything at this 
                point.

01/26/1995    Added real-time vertical scrolling. I managed to find a "trick" 
                to do this that made life easier. I sub-classed the MLE window
                procedure and trapped vertical scrolling messages so I could 
                update the MLE window.  I also found a bug in OS/2's MLE 
                control while doing this.  The Vertical scroll bar does not re-
                paint properly. This is because IBM chose to use the a dynamic 
                sizing scroll bar. It want's to change it's size each time you 
                scroll, but when I intercept scrolling messages from MLE it 
                seems to "forget" that it's a dynamic sizer, and doesn't resize.
                (Big black lines appear in it too. Things that make you go 
                hmmm....) 
                To work around this I force the scroll bar to repaint itself.
                This makes it "flicker" at the right edge a little, 
                but it's not that noticeable and it won't hurt
                anything. Probably can't even see it with a fast video card.
                Now I need to finish up the tab settings options.

01/28/1995    Finished "Settings-Tabs..." logic. Now tabs can be set to a 
                specified number of spaces (1-20) or the tab character 
                can be used.


---------------------------------------------------------------
01/28/1995    Began work on alpha 5.

01/29/1995    Added status bar to track current line and column, insert state,
                caps lock key state, and num lock key state. Gave status bar a
                3-D look. Added code for status bar. (This turned out to
                be much more work than I thought it would be.)

01/30/1995    Added "Word wrap" option to Settings menu.

01/30/1995    Made the "Find" button the default button in the find
                dialog. Made the "Verify" button the default button in
                the replace dialog. Made the "OK" button the default
                button in the Tab and About dialog.

01/30/1995    Discovered another bug in the IBM MLE control. It
                doesn't properly query the Key-state table when the
                insert key is pressed. I want the status bar to have
                "INS" and "OVR" for insert mode and overwrite mode.
                I'll see what I can do to work around this. So, the 
                INS/OVR may be incorrect depending on the state
                of a user's system. Although this is a minor 
                problem, I don't like it.

01/31/1995    Added current time to status bar.

01/31/1995    Made status visible or not visible based on menu selection
                "Status Bar" in the "Settings menu."

01/31/1995    Distributed Alpha 5 to alpha testers.

----------------------------------------------------------------
01/31/1995    Began work on Alpha 6.

02/01/1995    Changed name from BEDIT to ZED.

02/01/1995    Designed new, more professional looking icon.

02/01/1995    Made the file dialog boxes "remember" what directory you're
                in so you don't have to keep searching directories for files.

02/02/1995    Made the program multi-task better when opening large files.
                i.e. > 500K

02/03/1995    Added a %loaded to the title bar when loading.  Now when loading a
                a 1 meg file, you can see how much is done.

02/04/1995    Sent note to alpha testers that the named had changed.

02/05/1995    Started coding INI support.

02/05/1995    Saved window size and position in INI file.

02/05/1995    Save window background color in INI file.

02/06/1995    Save font in INI file.

02/07/1995    Send Alpha 6 out for tests.

----------------------------------------------------------------
02/08/1995    Began work on Alpha 7. (Lot of alphas, hugh? :)  )

02/08/1995    Added menu options to change color and font.

02/09/1995    Made ICON so it has bitmaps for all known modes:
                    CGA, EGA, XGA, VGA and small versions of each too. This
                 has greatly increased the size of ZED (About 35K)

02/09/1995    Save Tab settings in INI file

02/09/1995    Save Status Bar ON/OFF in INI file.

02/09/1995    Added DEFAULTICON to resource file so ZED icon shows up
                 in PM when you add ZED from a program template.

02/12/1995    Added recent file list logic.

02/12/1995    Made ZED capable or reading files with R attribute set.
                 (How stupid of me not to notice this earlier.)

02/12/1995    Made find and replace dialogs verify that user has entered some
                 text to search or replace.

02/12/1995    Made dialog boxes centered when they come up.

02/13/1995    Added auto-indent capability.

02/13/1995    Send Alpha 7 out for tests.

-----------------------------------------------------------

02/14/1995    Took Valentines day off...

02/15/1995 thru 02/20/1995  Failed to track project, but I worked on it
                  a whole lot.

02/22/1995    Color of text and background cannot be made the same now.

02/22/1995    Made palettes re-appear after a color or font change.

02/23/1995    Added help buttons and linked to case sensitive help on
                 Tab and Autosave dialog windows.

02/23/1995    Made online help extensive.

02/24/1995    Added real-time horizontal scrolling. This was a bitch.

02/24/1995    Optimized Vertical scrolling, was wasting CPU time calculating
                 new viewing position.

02/24/1995    Optimized Horizontal scrolling.

02/24/1995    Made find and find/replace dialogs auto-select text.

-----------------------------------------------------------
02/28/1995    Began work on Alpha 10

02/28/1995    Made "MODIFIED" 3D box larger so it doesn't go past 
                  the boundaries at high resolutions.

03/01/1995    Fixed recent file list.
