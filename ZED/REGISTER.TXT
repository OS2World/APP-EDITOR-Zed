Copyright information:

ZED text editor for OS/2 is Copyright (C) E. Bruce Shankle III.
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

ZED is a fully functional shareware text editor for OS/2.
This means that you are allowed to use this highly reliable, easy-to-use editor
and evaluate it for a period of 30 days.
ZED may not be resold, except with prior written authorization from E. Bruce
Shankle III, the author.  ZED may be copied for backup purposes or given without
charge to third parties.

If you wish to continue using ZED after the 30 day trial period, you must register
with the author for the nominal fee of $15.00 US currency.
When you register you will be assigned a serial number that you can use to 
obtain support via email, free upgrades, and notices of new products.

I've put many long hours of coding and testing into ZED.  My goal is to provide an editor
for OS/2 that is easier to use and more functional than those supplied with the system.
The shareware concept only works if the user does his/her part to support the authors.
If you find ZED useful and do not register, you're hurting me and other shareware
developers.  Shareware helps keep the software market competitive, and prices
lower for everyone.  So please register.
